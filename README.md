# 🐍 Snake 💧 Water 🔫 Gun — Python Game

A simple command-line **Snake, Water, Gun** game built in Python as part of my learning journey.

This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as conditional logic, dictionaries, and random choice generation.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

- The user selects:
  - Snake (s)
  - Water (w)
  - Gun (g)
- The computer randomly selects its choice.
- The program compares both choices.
- The winner is displayed based on game rules.
